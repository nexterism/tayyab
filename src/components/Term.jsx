              Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up
              one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem
              Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in
              classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem
              Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus
              Bonorum et Malorum"
